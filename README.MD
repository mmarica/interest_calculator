This script can be used to compute total interest earned from multiple accounts by parsing transaction files generated by the banks.

Supported file types:
- ING csv (RO)
- Raiffeisen XLSX (RO)
- Raiffeisen PDF (RO)

It is meant to be used on Ubuntu.

The ```pdftotext``` binary is used in order to parse the PDF files, so you need to install the package that provides it:
```shell
sudo apt install poppler-utils
```
